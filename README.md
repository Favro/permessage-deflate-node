# permessage-deflate [![Build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/faye/permessage-deflate-node.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/faye/permessage-deflate-node)

Implements the
[permessage-deflate](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-hybi-permessage-compression)
WebSocket protocol extension as a plugin for
[websocket-extensions](https://github.com/faye/websocket-extensions-node).

## Installation

```
$ npm install permessage-deflate
```

##Â Usage

Add the plugin to your extensions:

```js
var Extensions = require('websocket-extensions'),
    deflate    = require('permessage-deflate');

var exts = new Extensions();
exts.add(deflate);
```

The extension can be configured, for example:

```js
var Extensions = require('websocket-extensions'),
    deflate    = require('permessage-deflate');

deflate = deflate.configure({noContextTakeover: true});

var exts = new Extensions();
exts.add(deflate);
```

Supported options are:

* `noContextTakeover`: if `true`, stops the session reusing a deflate context
  between messages
* `requestNoContextTakeover`: if `true`, makes the session tell the other peer
  not to reuse a deflate context between messages
* `maxWindowBits`: an integer from `8` to `15` inclusive that sets the size of
  the session's sliding window
* `requestMaxWindowBits`: an integer from `8` to `15` inclusive to ask the other
  peer to use to set its sliding window size, if supported
